# A Data Analysis of USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) Data on the per capita availability, importation and exportation (and other findings) of _corn sweeteners_

*_Note: For the purposes of this data analysis, the term "corn sweeteners" includes the following: High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), dextrose, and glucose._*

### So, uh, why choose USDA data on *corn sweeteners*? 

As an American, I consider myself lucky that I had a Korean mom who stopped me from consuming a ton of junk food as a kid. (I still have a sweet tooth, though.)

(Sorry, Mom.)

I always thought she was just being unfair when she would snatch the Skittles out of my hand that I had nabbed during trick-or-treat or Halloween events, telling me that I shouldn't eat sweets like these because it was "bad for me."

She wasn't wrong. One particular ingredient she probably was talking about was high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a type of *corn sweetener* that causes ["weight gain, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and high triglyceride levels,"](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/high-fructose-corn-syrup/faq-20058201 "Link to MayoClinic website") effects that raise the risk of getting heart disease.

In the U.S., heart disease is the *number one* ["leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States."](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm#:~:text=Heart%20disease%20is%20the%20leading,1%20in%20every%204%20deaths.) 

HFCS is found in several kinds of food (yeah, not just Halloween candY) that we find ourselves eating *daily*:

* yogurt (sweetened)
* salad dressing
* certain kinds of breads 
* canned fruits
* juice 
* boxed dinners
* granola bars
* cereal 
* sauces/condiments
* coffee creamer
* energy/sports drinks 
* ice-cream (I know, real bummer)

A non-comprehensive list can be found on [this Healthline article](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-foods-with-high-fructose-corn-syrup#section20).

Of course, HFCS isn't the *only* kind of corn sweetener there is, but it has a particular bad reputation among healthcare professionals and conscious consumers watching out for their health.

That being said, other substances categorized by the USDA as a "corn sweetener" like dextrose and glucose also have negative health effects when not consumed in moderation.

Which raised questions I was curious about: *_Was the amount of corn sweetener the U.S. was producing, importing, exporting, etc. being tracked? How much corn sweetener is made in comparison to population?_*

The answer to the first question was yes, which brings us here to this mini data cleaning & analysis project today. 

### Getting and cleaning the data
