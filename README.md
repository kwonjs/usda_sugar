# A Data Analysis of USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) Data on the per capita availability, importation and exportation (and other findings) of _corn sweeteners_

*_Note: For the purposes of this data analysis, the term "corn sweeteners" includes the following: High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), dextrose, and glucose._*

### So, uh, why choose USDA data on *corn sweeteners*? 

As an American, I consider myself lucky that I had a Korean mom who stopped me from consuming a ton of junk food as a kid. (I still have a sweet tooth, though.)

(Sorry, Mom.)

I always thought she was just being unfair when she would snatch the Skittles out of my hand that I had nabbed during trick-or-treat or Halloween events, telling me that I shouldn't eat sweets like these because it was "bad for me."

She wasn't wrong. One particular ingredient she probably was talking about was high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a type of *corn sweetener* that causes ["weight gain, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and high triglyceride levels,"](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/high-fructose-corn-syrup/faq-20058201 "Link to MayoClinic website") effects that raise the risk of getting heart disease.

In the U.S., heart disease is the *number one* ["leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States."](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm#:~:text=Heart%20disease%20is%20the%20leading,1%20in%20every%204%20deaths.) 

HFCS is found in several kinds of food (yeah, not just Halloween candY) that we find ourselves eating *daily*:

* yogurt (sweetened)
* salad dressing
* certain kinds of breads 
* canned fruits
* juice 
* boxed dinners
* granola bars
* cereal 
* sauces/condiments
* coffee creamer
* energy/sports drinks 
* ice-cream (I know, real bummer)

A non-comprehensive list can be found on [this Healthline article](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-foods-with-high-fructose-corn-syrup#section20).

Of course, HFCS isn't the *only* kind of corn sweetener there is, but it has a particular bad reputation among healthcare professionals and conscious consumers watching out for their health.

That being said, other substances categorized by the USDA as a "corn sweetener" like dextrose and glucose also have negative health effects when not consumed in moderation.

Which raised questions I was curious about: *_Was the amount of corn sweetener the U.S. was producing, importing, exporting, etc. being tracked? How much corn sweetener is made in comparison to population?_*

The answer to the first question was yes, which brings us here to this mini data cleaning & analysis project today. 

### Getting and cleaning/refining the data

*_Note for @Jrue: The tool **Open Refine** corrupted on my computer - the macOS system wouldn't let me use this tool because it blocked all "malware" apps and I didn't find a workaround in time, unfortunately. I was limited to Google Sheets for cleanup because my data wasn't **messy** enough or only in pdf form to use a tool like **Tabula**. Thank you for your understanding!_*

Finding the data on USDA's website on corn sweeteners actually wasn't too hard. The department has the data on a page titled ["Sugar and Sweeteners Yearbook Tables"](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/sugar-and-sweeteners-yearbook-tables/).

The exact dataset I chose was titled "Corn Sweetener Supply, Use, and Trade."

When I loaded the dataset onto Google Sheets, I saw this introduction to the dataset:

!!!! ATTACH IMAGE OF USDA INTRO !!!!

I decided after looking at data on "Caloric sweeteners, per capita availability, 1966-2017" and the supply and use of glucose, dextrose, HCFS, and corn sweeteners as a whole in comparison with the U.S. population per year, each different corn sweetener with its own data on separate tab sheets, to **combine** these sheets.

I had to first modify the sheets so that if I created charts or pivot tables from this data that Google Sheets would be able to *read* this data in the first place.

The USDA data was fairly cleaned already but the headings were merged to be aesthetically pleasing (which wouldn't work for data analysis) and also vague.

After cleaning the headings, the data looked something like this.

I wanted to merge more data, however, so the final datasheet I was working with looked more like this:

!!! ATTACH IMAGE OF MERGED DATA 1 !!!!

!!! ATTACH IMAGE OF MERGED DATA 2 !!!!

The way I made my unique merged dataset was by taking columns from the original datasheets and merging them onto a new spreadsheet copied from the "per capita" data, because that was originally the dataseet I was most curious about analyzing.

The image above is for **dextrose** specifically, but I repeated this same process of copying and pasting particular columns I was interested in investigating (**production, imports, and exports**) for **hcfs, glucose, and dextrose** as well. This information wasn't available for **refined and raw cane and beet sugar or other substances like edible syrups and honey, which were labeled as sweeteners,** which is why I decided to focus on **corn sweeteners** specifically and delete the extra columns related to non-corn sweetener substances (which I highlighted in red). 

I noticed *__two major problems__* right off the bat after I went through this merging process.

1. The unit for "per capita availability" was in **pounds, dry weight.** The unit for "exports," "imports," and "production," however, were in **1000 short tons.**

Solution? A simple unit conversion, done easily through Google Sheets. 

I created a new column with the same column name I was going to convert (i.e. I took the "Total Imports (HFCS) in 1000 short tons" and created a new column beside it titled "Total Imports (HFCS) in pounds." 

In the new column, I typed in the first cell a function similar to this:

``` =A2 * 2000000  
```

A2 was the cell I was referencing
